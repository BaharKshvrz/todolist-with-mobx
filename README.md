# Getting React Todo List With Mobx

MobX is an open source state management tool.MobX, a simple, scalable, and standalone state management library, follows functional reactive programming (FRP) implementation and prevents inconsistent state by ensuring that all derivations are performed automatically.

MobX is a simple, scalable, boilerplate-free state management solution. It allows you to manage application state outside of any UI framework, making the code decoupled, portable and, above all, easy to test.

It implements observable values, which are essentially using the publish/subscribe pattern. They differ in that the subscriptions are handled automatically. The engine tracks where you used the observables and only re-executes the side effects, like a render, if they change.
